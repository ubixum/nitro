# The below set of functions implement an atomic decorator. Use this to
# wrap a function whose first argument is a nitro.Device with a lock()
# and unlock() mechanism. This decorator can be used on a class that extends
# nitro.Device or on a function whose first argument is a nitro.Device.
#
# Example:
#
# @nitro.atomic
# def myfunction(dev, **kw):
#     pass
#
def _lock(f, dev,*args,**kw):
    log.debug("Locking dev for %s" % f)
    dev.lock()
    try:
        return f(dev,*args, **kw)
    finally:
        log.debug("Unlocking dev for %s" % f)
        dev.unlock()

try:
    """
    Try to use the decorator package if possible.  This way the 
    function parameters etc are preserved

class DevBase(object):
    """This is a wrapper class that lets you easily 'upgrade' a base
    nitro device to an application specific class. You extend this
    device and add your own custom methods. The user can then still
    call all the nitro device base methods, like get() and set(). You
    need to call the constructor of this device with the base device
    as the arguement. It will save the device reference off as
    self.dev. Then when the user makes a function call to your class,
    it will first check your class for the function, and if it does
    not exist it will then try to call the same function on self.dev.

    So suppose you had an imager plugged into the base nitro dev and
    wanted to add a capture() method to that device:

    class Imager(nitro.DevBase):
        def __init__(self, dev, myargs):
            nitro.DevBase.__init__(self, dev)

        def capture(self):
            pass


    Now the user can do the following to upgrade his device to your
    new Imager class:

    dev = nitro.USBDevice(0xFFFF, 0xAAAA)
    dev.open()
    dev = Imager(dev)
    dev.get("Imager", "version")
    img = dev.capture()
    dev.close()

    This is very useful when a generic device manager is used to find
    and open devices and you can't extend the device directly.

        """Call this method after the parent method has initialized the DI.
